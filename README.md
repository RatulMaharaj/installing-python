# Installing Python

Installing Python always seems to be some complex decision tree experiment. Do you have Windows or macOS? Is Python already installed? Is it the right version? And so on.

This repo is a place to allow for feedback and conversations around our **[Installing Python from Talk Python Training how-to article](https://training.talkpython.fm/installing-python)**.

See the article source via [`install-python.md`](./install-python.md).
